# Rosalind-Plus-Plus
Rosalind but plus plus

Might need to reload CMake and Rebuild project

**Approach to the project:** 

Run a calculator on Rosalind's input. Once Rosalind has accepted that input we can start creating our own input strings. 
We'll create an input string and use the calculator to generate an output string for the input. The validator only needs 
ensure that a user's input string matches the output string created by the calculator.
